# Introduction
This repository contains an example web portal for a hypothetical animal adoption agency for the purposes of the DevOps Azure Sprint Series. This code has been intentionally developed as a simple demonstration and should not be used as a base for any production development. For more information on how to develop microservices and .NET Core services please refer to the following links.

# Instructions
#test
Install the following prerequisites:
- [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)

Clone the Git repository and open the root folder in Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code. Push F5 to start debugging.

We recommend using a free [Windows Virtual Machine](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/) for development if your development environment does not support installation of the .NET Core SDK.

When the services are running you can view and interact with the front end portal [here](http://localhost:9000/).
